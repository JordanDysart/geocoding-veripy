# geocoding-veripy
*batch checking geocoding requests.*

TODO.

1. Read csv file
2. Log the processes as they happen
3. GET google info
4. Pass and parse returning information
5. write to original csv file/ or new file that will give us some insight to what was returned.

Maybe write some tests too!
