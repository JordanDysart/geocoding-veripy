# geocoding-veripy
*batch checking geocoding requests.*

TODO.

1. ✅ Read csv file
2. ✅ Log the processes as they happen
3. ✅ GET google info
4. ✅ Pass and parse returning information
5. ✅ write to original csv file/ or new file that will give us some insight to what was returned.

Maybe write some tests too! 🚫
